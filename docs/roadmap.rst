Roadmap
=======

sci-wms is funded by a number of organizations to fufill the specific
needs of the Metorology and Oceanography communities. We are
committed to ensuring that the project follows a logical and innovative
path, but due to time and budget constraints some enhancements and
updates will take precedence over others.

We welcome discussion of problems and suggestions for new features at
the `sci-wms issues page <https://github.com/sci-wms/sci-wms/issues>`_.
Enhancements that have been accepted by the team for inclusion into the project can
be found at the issues page as being tagged with a release version `repository <https://github.com/sci-wms/sci-wms/issues?state=open>`_.
